Idle Hands

..the devil’s tools.

You have an Idleness bar. Whenever it fills you ‘play’ a hand of poker and either win or lose. When you win, you get Cash. When you lose you get Salt. After you lose 6 games in a row you unlock Cheating, which gives you Sin and increases your chance of winning, but also gives you a chance to get caught which causes you to lose all your Cash. Cash is used to upgrade your Idleness bar which lets you play more and/or better hands. After you accumulate sufficient Sin you unlock the ability to summon Demons which lets you spend Sin and Salt to gain Fame.
